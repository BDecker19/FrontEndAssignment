# Front-end assignment.

We've been approached by Brooklyn Ltd and ECardly Ltd. To turn create their new homepage design as HTML / CSS. The deadline is tight (tomorrow), but their in-house designer has provided home assets and a template of the design to get started.

Our job is to take these approved mockup designs, and recreate them in HTML  / CSS so that they are *pixel perfect* with the design.

Our client has also stipulated that they want the solution to work cross-browser in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. They did a survey and none of their clients use IE (this is a dream brief!)

# Instructions
1. Fork this repo and clone it as normal
2. Add HTML / CSS, git commit after you add
each feature! I want to see more than 2 commits!
3. Push back to your own origin
4. Send me a pull request
